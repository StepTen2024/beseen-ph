# Family Activities in Angeles City & Clark

Angeles City and Clark aren't just for adults. Whether you're living here with kids or visiting with family, there's actually a lot to do that doesn't involve the nightlife scene everyone talks about.

Here's your guide to keeping the whole family entertained.

---

## 🦕 Theme Parks & Attractions

### Dinosaurs Island
**Location:** Clark Freeport Zone  
**Price:** ~₱600/adult, ~₱500/child  
**Best For:** Dinosaur-obsessed kids (so, all kids)

Life-sized animatronic dinosaurs in a jungle setting. Kids lose their minds here. The dinosaurs move and make sounds, there's a playground area, and it's genuinely well-done for a Philippine attraction.

**Tips:**
- Go early morning or late afternoon to avoid peak heat
- Bring water—there's not much shade
- The gift shop at the end is a trap; be prepared to negotiate

**Time needed:** 2-3 hours

---

### Aqua Planet
**Location:** Clark Freeport Zone  
**Price:** ~₱900-1200/person (check for promos)  
**Best For:** Hot days, water lovers, bigger kids

The biggest water park in the region. Wave pools, slides, lazy rivers, and enough activities to fill a full day. Get there when it opens to maximize slide time before lines build up.

**Tips:**
- Rent a cabana if you can—worth it for shade and storage
- Bring waterproof bags for phones/valuables
- Weekdays are significantly less crowded

**Time needed:** Full day

---

### Zoocobia Fun Zoo
**Location:** Clark Freeport Zone  
**Price:** ~₱495/person  
**Best For:** Animal encounters, younger kids

A more hands-on zoo experience where kids can feed and interact with animals. They have goats, rabbits, birds, and various other critters. Also has a Gravity Car ride that's fun for older kids and adults.

**Tips:**
- The Gravity Car has height/age restrictions—check before promising kids
- Bird feeding is a hit with little ones
- It's smaller than expected; 2-3 hours is enough

**Time needed:** 2-3 hours

---

### Nayong Pilipino Clark
**Location:** Clark Freeport Zone  
**Price:** ~₱300/person  
**Best For:** Cultural education, school field trips

A cultural park showcasing different regions of the Philippines through replica villages. It's educational and a good way for kids (and adults) to learn about Filipino heritage. It's quiet, not crowded, and there's a lot of space to walk around.

**Tips:**
- Combine with another Clark attraction for a full day
- Bring a picnic—there are nice grounds
- Best for kids old enough to appreciate the cultural aspect

**Time needed:** 1-2 hours

---

## 🎮 Indoor Activities (Escape the Heat)

### Timezone / Arcade Zones
**Location:** SM City Clark, Marquee Mall  
**Price:** Load cards as needed (₱200-500 for a good session)  
**Best For:** Rainy days, arcade lovers

When it's 35°C outside and the kids need to burn energy, the mall arcades are your friend. Air-conditioned, loud, and fun.

---

### SM Bowling
**Location:** SM City Clark  
**Price:** ~₱150-200/game  
**Best For:** Family competition, all ages

Good old-fashioned bowling. Gutter guards available for little kids. A few games, some snacks, and everyone's happy.

---

### Cinemas
**Location:** SM City Clark, Marquee Mall  
**Price:** ~₱250-400/ticket  
**Best For:** Rainy afternoons, movie lovers

Both malls have modern cinemas with Hollywood releases. IMAX at SM Clark if you want the full experience.

---

### Kidzoona / Play Areas
**Location:** Various malls  
**Price:** ~₱200-400/hour  
**Best For:** Toddlers and younger kids

Indoor playgrounds with ball pits, slides, and climbing structures. Parents can sit in the air-conditioning while kids go wild.

---

## 🏊 Swimming & Outdoors

### Hotel Day Passes
Several hotels in Clark offer day use of their pools. This is great for a "resort day" without staying overnight.

**Options:**
- **Widus Hotel** - Nice pool, can be busy on weekends
- **Midori Hotel** - Quieter, good facilities
- **Quest Hotel** - Family-friendly, central location

Prices vary from ₱500-1500/person depending on inclusions.

---

### Fontana Water Park
**Location:** Clark  
**Price:** ~₱800-1000/person for day pass  
**Best For:** Hot spring pools, relaxed water park

Hot spring-fed pools plus water slides. It's more relaxed than Aqua Planet but still fun for kids. The warm water pools are nice if the weather's cooler.

---

### Puning Hot Spring
**Location:** Porac, Pampanga (outside Angeles)  
**Price:** ~₱1500-2500/person (includes 4x4 ride)  
**Best For:** Older kids, adventure seekers

A half-day adventure that involves a 4x4 ride through lahar fields and volcanic ash to reach natural hot springs. Younger kids might find the ride bumpy; it's better for ages 7+.

---

## 🍽️ Kid-Friendly Restaurants

### Shakey's
Why it works: Play area, pizza, Mojos. The reliable choice.

### Jollibee
Why it works: It's Jollibee. Chickenjoy, spaghetti, happiness.

### Yellow Cab
Why it works: Big pizzas, chill vibe, good for groups.

### Vikings (SM Clark)
Why it works: Buffet = kids can pick whatever they want. Adults can actually enjoy food too.

### Restaurant with Play Areas
- **Aling Lucing's** has outdoor space
- Several Clark restaurants have gardens where kids can run

## 🌄 Day Trips from Angeles

### Mt. Pinatubo Crater
**Best For:** Older kids (10+), adventure families

The trek is doable for fit older kids, and the crater lake at the end is spectacular. But it's a long day—4x4 ride plus 2-hour hike each way. Not for toddlers.

---

### Sandbox at Alviera
**Location:** Porac (30-40 mins from Angeles)  
**Best For:** Adventure activities, teens

Giant swing, ATV rides, wall climbing, and more. It's an adventure park that's great for older kids and teenagers who need more excitement than a water park provides.

2. **Bring water everywhere** - Dehydration is real
3. **Mall hopping is valid** - Air conditioning + activities = happy family
4. **Sunday is family day** - Everything is busier; plan accordingly
