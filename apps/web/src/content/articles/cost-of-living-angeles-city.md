# Cost of Living in Angeles City - Expat's Budget Breakdown

One of the first questions anyone asks when considering Angeles City: "How much does it cost to live there?"

The answer, like most things, is: it depends. But we can give you real numbers based on how people actually live here—not some fantasy budget or luxury lifestyle estimate.

## The Quick Answer

**Comfortable living for a single expat:** ₱60,000-100,000/month ($1,100-1,800 USD)

**Budget living (local style):** ₱30,000-50,000/month ($550-900 USD)

**Upscale living (condos, nice restaurants):** ₱120,000-200,000+/month ($2,200-3,600+ USD)

These ranges assume you're renting, not buying. Now let's break it down.

## 🏠 Housing

Housing is one of the biggest variables. You can pay ₱8,000/month for a basic apartment or ₱60,000+ for a luxury condo. Most expats fall somewhere in between.

### Apartments / Houses for Rent

| Type | Monthly Rent | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Studio apartment (basic) | ₱8,000-15,000 | Local-style, maybe no AC in bedroom |
| 1BR apartment (decent) | ₱15,000-25,000 | With AC, decent area |
| 2BR apartment (nice) | ₱25,000-40,000 | Good for couples, proper kitchen |
| House (3BR) | ₱30,000-60,000 | Depends heavily on location |
| Condo (modern) | ₱25,000-50,000 | In Clark area, newer buildings |
| Condo (upscale) | ₱50,000-80,000+ | Amenities, pool, security |

### Best Areas for Expats
- **Malabanias** - Popular, lots of amenities, moderate prices
