## 🏆 The Best Coffee Shops for Remote Work

### 1. Bo's Coffee (SM City Clark)
**WiFi Speed:** 15-25 Mbps  
**Outlet Availability:** Good  
**Coffee Rating:** ☕☕☕☕ (4/5)

Bo's is the reliable choice. Local coffee chain, consistent quality, and the mall location means air conditioning and foot traffic that makes it feel okay to camp out. The WiFi is stable, there are outlets along the walls, and no one bothers you.

**Best for:** Solid, reliable work sessions
**Order:** Their single-origin pour-over if you care about coffee, iced mocha if you don't

---

### 2. Starbucks (Various Locations)
**WiFi Speed:** 10-20 Mbps  
**Outlet Availability:** Okay (limited)  
**Coffee Rating:** ☕☕☕ (3/5)

Look, we know. It's Starbucks. But the WiFi works, the chairs are comfortable, and nobody judges you for staying all day. The problem is outlet availability—get there early to snag a seat near one.

**Best for:** When you need predictability
**Order:** Whatever keeps you caffeinated

**Locations:**
- SM City Clark
- Marquee Mall
- Widus Hotel area

---

### 3. Caffé Mitra
**WiFi Speed:** 10-15 Mbps  
**Outlet Availability:** Limited  
**Coffee Rating:** ☕☕☕☕☕ (5/5)

If you actually care about coffee quality, Caffé Mitra is your spot. Local cafe, proper espresso, and a more authentic vibe than the chains. Smaller space, so it can get busy, but the coffee is worth it.

**Best for:** Coffee snobs, shorter work sessions
**Order:** Flat white—they actually know how to make it

---

### 4. Costa Coffee (Marquee Mall)
**WiFi Speed:** 15-20 Mbps  
**Outlet Availability:** Good  
**Coffee Rating:** ☕☕☕☕ (4/5)

Costa is Starbucks' British cousin, and honestly, the coffee's a bit better. The Marquee location is spacious, the WiFi is solid, and there are usually outlets available.

**Best for:** Mall-based work days
**Order:** The flat white is solid

---

### 5. The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf
**WiFi Speed:** 10-15 Mbps  
**Outlet Availability:** Okay  
**Coffee Rating:** ☕☕☕ (3/5)

Another reliable chain option. Nothing special, but nothing wrong either. The SM Clark location has decent seating.

**Best for:** When Bo's is full
**Order:** The Ice Blended drinks are their thing

---

### 6. Craft Coffee Revolution
**WiFi Speed:** 20-30 Mbps  
**Outlet Availability:** Good  
**Coffee Rating:** ☕☕☕☕☕ (5/5)

Specialty coffee shop with serious beans. Smaller indie cafe that actually cares about their coffee. The owner knows their stuff, the WiFi is surprisingly fast, and the vibe is work-friendly.

**Best for:** Coffee enthusiasts who need to work
**Order:** Ask what's freshly roasted

## Backup Plans

### When Cafe WiFi Fails

1. **Mobile data** - Get a local SIM with data. Globe and Smart both have good coverage in Angeles.
2. **Pocket WiFi** - Rent one from the airport or buy prepaid
3. **Hotel lobbies** - Some hotels have work areas with reliable WiFi
4. **Coworking spaces** - There are a few in Clark (see below)

### Coworking Spaces in Clark

If you need serious work infrastructure:

- **Clock In** - Proper coworking setup with meeting rooms
- **Various serviced offices** - More formal, daily/monthly rates

---

## Cafe Etiquette for Remote Workers

1. **Buy something every 2 hours** - At minimum. Don't nurse one coffee for 6 hours.
2. **Don't take up a 4-person table** - If you're solo, sit accordingly
3. **Use headphones for calls** - Nobody wants to hear your Zoom meeting
4. **Peak hours = time to go** - If lunch rush hits and there's a line, pack up
5. **Tip the staff** - Especially if you're camping out

---

## Power Tips

- Bring a power strip - One outlet becomes three
- Battery backup - For those cafes with no outlets
- Sit strategically - Scout outlets before ordering
- Morning is best - Cafes are emptier, outlets are available

---

## The Verdict

**Best overall for work:** Bo's Coffee at SM Clark - Reliable, comfortable, no judgment

**Best coffee quality:** Caffé Mitra or Craft Coffee Revolution - If you actually care about beans

**Best for long sessions:** Costa Coffee at Marquee - Space, outlets, solid WiFi

**Best backup:** Starbucks anywhere - Predictable, everywhere, works
