# Top 10 Korean Restaurants in Clark for Authentic K-Food

Here's something not everyone knows: Clark has one of the largest Korean expat communities in the Philippines. There are Korean international schools, Korean churches, Korean grocery stores, and—most importantly for us—a ton of authentic Korean restaurants.

Forget the Westernized Korean places in Manila. Out here, Korean restaurants are run by Koreans, for Koreans. And that means the food is the real deal.

## Why Clark for Korean Food?

Korean investment in Clark Freeport Zone has been significant for decades. There are Korean business owners, retirees, families with kids in Korean schools, and a steady flow of tourists. This community supports restaurants that don't have to water down their flavors for the Western palate.

When a Korean restaurant in Clark serves kimchi jjigae, it tastes like it would in Seoul. That's the difference.
