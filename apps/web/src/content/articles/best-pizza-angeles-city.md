# Best Pizza in Angeles City - Where to Get Your Fix

Let's be real: finding good pizza in the Philippines can be hit or miss. But Angeles City? This town punches way above its weight when it comes to pizza. Maybe it's the mix of expats, foreign business owners, and locals who've developed a serious pizza habit. Whatever the reason, you've got options here.

We spent way too many nights eating pizza so you don't have to play roulette with your dinner. Here's the definitive guide to pizza in Angeles City.

## 🏆 The Top Picks

### 1. Piero's Italian Restaurant
**Location:** Malabanias, Angeles City  
**Price Range:** ₱350-600 per pizza  
**Best For:** Authentic thin-crust Italian

If you want the closest thing to actual Italian pizza in Angeles, Piero's is your spot. Run by—you guessed it—an Italian guy named Piero, this place doesn't mess around. The dough is made fresh daily, the sauce is simple (tomatoes, garlic, basil), and they don't drown everything in cheese like a lot of places do.

**What to order:** The Margherita is the test of any pizzeria, and Piero's nails it. Simple, perfect, no gimmicks. If you want something meatier, the Diavola (spicy salami) is excellent.

**The vibe:** Cozy, unpretentious Italian restaurant feel. Good for dates or just a solid dinner out.

### 2. La Dolce Italia
**Location:** Clark Freeport Zone  
**Price Range:** ₱400-700 per pizza  
**Best For:** Upscale Italian dining with pizza

This is Clark's answer to proper Italian dining. The pizza here is legit—wood-fired oven, imported ingredients, the works. It's pricier than your neighborhood pizza joint, but you can taste the difference.

**What to order:** The Quattro Formaggi is dangerously good. Four cheeses, garlic, and a slight drizzle of honey if you ask nice. The Frutti di Mare (seafood) pizza is also excellent if you like shrimp and calamari on your pie.

**The vibe:** More upscale than most spots on this list. Good for impressing someone or treating yourself.

---

### 3. Yellow Cab Pizza Co.
**Location:** SM City Clark, Marquee Mall, Fields Avenue  
**Price Range:** ₱450-800 per pizza  
**Best For:** Big portions, American-style pizza

Yeah, it's a chain. But Yellow Cab consistently delivers big, cheesy, American-style pizzas that hit the spot when you want quantity with quality. Their pizzas are massive—the "18-inch" is no joke—and they've got delivery on lock.

**What to order:** The #4 Cheese is a crowd favorite (yes, it's just four types of cheese, and it's glorious). The New York's Finest with pepperoni and Italian sausage is the classic order.

**The vibe:** Casual, fast-casual dining. Perfect for groups, families, or when you need pizza for 10 people in 30 minutes.

---

### 4. Shakey's
**Location:** Multiple locations  
**Price Range:** ₱350-600 per pizza  
**Best For:** Thin crust nostalgia, group dinners

Shakey's has been in the Philippines forever, and the thin crust here is actually legit. It's not gourmet, but when you want that crispy thin crust with Manager's Choice (pepperoni, sausage, beef, mushroom, bell pepper, onion), it just works.

**What to order:** Manager's Choice thin crust. It's a classic for a reason. Add their Mojos (seasoned potato wedges) because you have to.

**The vibe:** Family-friendly chain restaurant. Kids love it, adults tolerate it, everyone leaves full.

---

### 5. Ristorante Bella Napoli
**Location:** Balibago, Angeles City  
**Price Range:** ₱380-650 per pizza  
**Best For:** Neapolitan-style pizza

This place focuses on Neapolitan-style pizza—softer crust, higher hydration dough, blistered edges from high heat. If you know the difference between Roman and Neapolitan pizza, you'll appreciate what they're doing here.

**What to order:** The Napoli (anchovies, capers, olives) is authentic but divisive. Play it safe with the Prosciutto e Funghi.

**The vibe:** Mid-range Italian restaurant. Good for a casual dinner or lunch.

## 🍕 Honorable Mentions

### Grumpy Joe's
**Location:** Malabanias  
**Why it's here:** Great bar pizza. Nothing fancy, but when you're three beers deep and need food, their pepperoni pizza is exactly what you want.

### Pizza Hut
**Location:** Various malls  
**Why it's here:** Look, sometimes you just want the cheesy stuffed crust from your childhood. No shame in it.

### Greenwich
**Location:** Everywhere  
**Why it's here:** Budget-friendly Filipino-style pizza. The Hawaiian is weirdly good. Don't @ us.

## 🌙 Late Night Pizza Options

When it's 1 AM and you need pizza, your options narrow down. Here's what delivers late:

1. **Yellow Cab** - Delivers until 10-11 PM depending on location
2. **Shakey's** - Similar hours
3. **Grab Food** - Your best bet for late night, check what's still open
4. **Domino's** - If there's one near you, they deliver fairly late

For REALLY late (like Walking Street is closing late), your best bet is the random pizza joints on Fields that cater to the late-night crowd. Quality varies wildly, but they're open.

## 🔥 Pizza Delivery Rankings

For pure delivery convenience:

1. **Yellow Cab** - Fast, reliable, app works well
2. **Shakey's** - Also reliable, good promos
3. **Grab Food** - Access to the smaller restaurants
4. **Pizza Hut** - App is sometimes glitchy but pizza arrives hot
